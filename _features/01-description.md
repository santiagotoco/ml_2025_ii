### Course goal
Machine learning (ML) aims to build systems capable of learning from experience and adapting their behavior accordingly. It offers powerful methods for extracting insights from large volumes of data and has become a cornerstone in fields such as bioinformatics, information retrieval, business analytics, and autonomous systems.

This course emphasizes the mathematical, statistical, and computational principles that underpin machine learning. These core concepts are critical for analyzing current algorithms, designing new models, and applying ML effectively to real-world challenges.
