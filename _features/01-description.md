### Course goal
The main goal of Machine Learning (ML) is the development of systems that are able to autonomously change their behavior based on experience. ML offers some of the more effective techniques for knowledge discovery in large data sets. ML has played a fundamental role in areas such as bioinformatics, information retrieval, business intelligence and autonomous vehicle development.

The main goal of this course is to study the computational, mathematical and statistical foundations of ML, which are essential for the theoretical analysis of existing learning algorithms, the development of new algorithms and the well-founded application of ML to solve real-world problems.
